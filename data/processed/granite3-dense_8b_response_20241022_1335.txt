1. Conversation 1:
   - Device Identification: TechCorp (MFG name) devices with MAC addresses 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E and 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34 are involved.
   - Communication Details: The communicating devices are from TechCorp, with IP addresses 172.16.50.1 and 198.51.100.2. They use TCP protocol with ephemeral ports (EPH) for outgoing and incoming traffic. Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS communication.
   - Traffic Volume: A total of 5118.0 packets were exchanged between the devices.
   - Implications and Concerns: This conversation appears to be normal, as it involves communication between two TechCorp devices using port 443 for HTTPS traffic.

2. Conversation 2:
   - Device Identification: TechCorp (MFG name) devices with MAC addresses 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F and 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34 are involved.
   - Communication Details: The communicating devices are from TechCorp, with IP addresses 172.16.60.1 and 198.51.100.2. They use TCP protocol with ephemeral ports (EPH) for outgoing and incoming traffic. Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS communication.
   - Traffic Volume: A total of 2333.0 packets were exchanged between the devices.
   - Implications and Concerns: This conversation appears to be normal, as it involves communication between two TechCorp devices using port 443 for HTTPS traffic.

3. Conversation 3:
   - Device Identification: TechCorp (MFG name) devices with MAC addresses 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E and 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34 are involved.
   - Communication Details: The communicating devices are from TechCorp, with IP addresses 172.16.50.1 and 203.0.113.6. They use TCP protocol with ephemeral ports (EPH) for outgoing and incoming traffic. Port 443 is commonly used for HTTPS communication.
   - Traffic Volume: A total of 3.0 packets were exchanged between the devices.
   - Implications and Concerns: This conversation shows an attempted remote access to a device with IP address 203.0.113.6, which is not part of the baseline/allowlist. Further research is needed to determine if this is a legitimate or malicious activity.

4. Conversation 4:
   - Device Identification: IndustrialTech (MFG name) devices with MAC addresses 5C:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE and FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF are involved.
   - Communication Details: The communicating device is from IndustrialTech, with IP address 172.16.1.1. It uses ARP protocol for outgoing traffic and IGMP protocol for incoming traffic. The destination IP address is 224.0.0.1, which is a multicast address.
   - Traffic Volume: A total of 863986.0 packets were exchanged between the devices.
   - Implications and Concerns: This conversation shows unusual activity involving both ARP and IGMP protocols for an IndustrialTech device. Further research is needed to determine if this is a legitimate or malicious activity.
