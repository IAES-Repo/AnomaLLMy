## ICS Connection Anomaly Analysis Report

This report analyzes connection data flagged as anomalies within an ICS environment. Each conversation is evaluated based on device identification, communication details, traffic volume, and potential implications. 

**Conversation 1:**

1. **Device Identification:**  
    - SRC: 172.16.50.1 - TechCorp Device (MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
    - DST: 198.51.100.2 - NetSys Device (MAC: 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34)

2. **Communication Details:**  
    - TechCorp device initiates TCP connection on ephemeral port to NetSys device's port 443 (HTTPS). The NetSys device responds on its own ephemeral port.

3. **Traffic Volume:** 5118 packets exchanged.

4. **Implications and Concerns:** 
    - Communication between an internal TechCorp device and a potentially external NetSys device on HTTPS port 443 raises concerns. Further research is required to determine the legitimacy of this connection, the purpose of communication, and the identity of the NetSys device. Is NetSys a trusted vendor?

**Conversation 2:**

1. **Device Identification:**  
    - SRC: 172.16.60.1 - TechCorp Device (MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F)
    - DST: 198.51.100.2 - NetSys Device (MAC: 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34)

2. **Communication Details:**  
    - Similar to Conversation 1, a TechCorp device initiates TCP connection on ephemeral port to NetSys device's port 443 (HTTPS). The NetSys device responds on its own ephemeral port.

3. **Traffic Volume:** 2385 packets exchanged.

4. **Implications and Concerns:**
    -  Similar concerns as Conversation 1. Further investigation is needed to understand the context of this communication and ensure legitimate access.


**Conversation 3:**

1. **Device Identification:**  
    - SRC: 172.16.50.1 - TechCorp Device (MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
    - DST: 203.0.113.6 (Potentially external IP address)

2. **Communication Details:**  
    - A TechCorp device initiates TCP connection on ephemeral port to an external IP address (possibly a cloud service or another system) using HTTPS port 443. The remote device does not respond significantly.

3. **Traffic Volume:** 3 packets exchanged.

4. **Implications and Concerns:**
    - Attempted communication with an external IP address, possibly indicating attempted remote access to the ICS environment. Further investigation is crucial to determine the legitimacy of this connection and identify the remote system's purpose. The second connection from another TechCorp device to the same IP address was likely blocked.

**Conversation 4:**

1. **Device Identification:**
    - SRC: 172.16.1.1 - IndustrialTech Device (MAC: 18:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE)
    - DST:  Broadcast Address (224.0.0.1) for IGMP discovery

2. **Communication Details:**
    - IndustrialTech device performs ARP traffic to discover devices on the network and sends IGMP messages, which are used for multicast group management in streaming protocols.

3. **Traffic Volume:** 863986 packets exchanged (highly unusual).

4. **Implications and Concerns:**
    - The extremely high volume of ARP and IGMP traffic indicates a potential anomaly or issue within the IndustrialTech device or its network configuration. Investigate why this device is generating such a large amount of multicast traffic.

**General Observations:**


*  The presence of multiple connections to external IP addresses (198.51.100.2 and 203.0.113.6) requires further investigation, as it might signify unauthorized access attempts or potentially malicious activity.
* The high volume of traffic in Conversation 4 warrants immediate attention as it could indicate a malfunctioning device or a network-wide issue.

**Recommendations:**


*  Identify and verify the legitimacy of all external IPs involved in the communication with internal ICS devices.
*  Log and monitor all connections to/from external IPs, paying particular attention to any unusual traffic patterns or activities.
* Investigate the cause of the excessive ARP and IGMP traffic in Conversation 4 to identify and resolve the underlying issue.
