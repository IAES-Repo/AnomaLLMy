| Traffic Volume (CNT) | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| No packets exchanged between devices |

**Anomalies Identified**

* Conversation 1: The connection from TechCorp to NetSys is likely an internal communication within their ICS environment.
* Conversation 2: The connection from TechCorp and NetSys appears to be a legitimate exchange of data, but the fact that they are communicating with each other suggests potential security concerns.
* Conversation 3: The connection from TechCorp and NetSys may indicate malicious activity, as it is attempting remote access on an ephemeral port (443 EPH).
* Conversation 4: The ARP broadcast indicates unusual behavior, suggesting that this connection may be related to unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

**Recommendations**

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

1. Investigate the potential security implications of Conversation 3.
2. Monitor for further anomalies in Conversations 2 and 4.
3. Verify the legitimacy of the devices involved in all connections by performing a network scan.
4. Take steps to secure the affected devices or systems.

**Baseline/Allowlist Analysis**

This connection data indicates that at least two connections from TechCorp to NetSys are anomalous, suggesting potential security threats. Further investigation is necessary to determine the nature and severity of these incidents.
