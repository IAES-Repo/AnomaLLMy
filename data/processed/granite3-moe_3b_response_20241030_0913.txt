===============================

1. Device Identification:
   - Conversation 1: TechCorp (172.16.50.1, 198.51.100.2) and NetSys (172.16.50.1, 198.51.100.2)
   - Conversation 2: TechCorp (172.16.60.1, 198.51.100.2) and NetSys (172.16.60.1, 198.51.100.2)
   - Conversation 3: TechCorp (172.16.50.1, 203.0.113.6) and NetSys (10:AB:CD:EF:12:34, 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
   - Conversation 4: TechCorp (NaN, NaN), IndustrialTech (5C:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE, FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), and BROADCAST (863986.0)

2. Communication Details:
   - Conversation 1: Both devices use TCP with EPH as the outgoing and incoming ports. TechCorp is the source device, and NetSys is the destination device.
   - Conversation 2: Both devices use TCP with EPH as the outgoing and incoming ports. TechCorp is the source device, and NetSys is the destination device.
   - Conversation 3: TechCorp is the source device, and NetSys is the destination device. The destination IP address is a broadcast address.
   - Conversation 4: Both devices use ARP with EPH as the outgoing port. TechCorp is the source device, and IndustrialTech is the destination device.
   - Conversation 5: Both devices use IGMP with EPH as the outgoing and incoming ports. NetSys is the source device, and NetSys is the destination device.

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Conversation 1: 2785 packets exchanged
   - Conversation 2: 2333 packets exchanged
   - Conversation 3: 1193 packets exchanged
   - Conversation 4: 863986 packets exchanged
   - Conversation 5: 3334 packets exchanged

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - Conversation 1, 2, and 3: These conversations are in the csv file and were picked up as an anomaly. They need further research to determine if they are part of the baseline/allowlist or not.
   - Conversation 4: This conversation is unusual for industrial control systems. The source IP address is a broadcast address, which could indicate a network scanning activity. The destination IP address is IndustrialTech, which suggests that the device is using ARP to discover other devices on the network. The traffic volume is high, indicating that this device is actively engaging in network discovery activities.
   - Conversation 5: This conversation is also unusual for industrial control systems. The source and destination IP addresses are the same, which could indicate a man-in-the-middle attack or a misconfigured device. The traffic volume is moderate, indicating that this device is actively engaging in network communication activities.
