### Analysis of ICS Connection Conversation

**Conversation Overview:**
The following analysis is based on the connection conversation provided, focusing on identifying devices involved, communication details, traffic volume, and potential implications.

#### Device Identification:
- **Source Device (SRC):**
  - IP Address: `172.16.60.1`
  - MAC Address: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F`
  - Manufacturer (MFG): `TechCorp`

- **Destination Device (DST):**
  - IP Address: `198.51.100.2`
  - MAC Address: `10:AB:CD:EF:12:34`
  - Manufacturer (MFG): `NetSys`

#### Communication Details:
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Source Port (SRCPORT):** EPH (Ephemeral port used by the source device)
- **Destination Port (DSTPORT):** `443` (Standard HTTPS/SSL/TLS port)

  - **Outgoing Traffic:**
    - Source Device (`TechCorp`) is initiating a connection to Destination Device (`NetSys`) using an ephemeral port and targeting port `443`.
    - This suggests that `TechCorp` is likely a device requesting secure communication with the external server `NetSys`.

  - **Incoming Traffic:**
    - Destination Device (`NetSys`) responds on port `443` to the source device's (`TechCorp`) ephemeral port.
    - This indicates that `NetSys` is an external entity providing HTTPS services back to the internal `TechCorp` device.

#### Traffic Volume:
- **Total Packets Exchanged (CNT):** `1192.0` packets from `TechCorp` to `NetSys`.
- **Total Packets Exchanged (CNT):** `1193.0` packets from `NetSys` to `TechCorp`.

#### Implications and Concerns:
This connection is noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **External Communication:**
   - The destination IP address (`198.51.100.2`) appears to be external, as it falls outside the typical range of internal private network addresses.
   - This suggests that `TechCorp` device is communicating with an external server, which could indicate a potential data exfiltration risk or unauthorized communication.

2. **HTTPS Communication:**
   - Port `443` usage indicates encrypted traffic, making the actual content difficult to inspect without further decryption tools.
   - However, even if the content is secure, establishing HTTPS connections from industrial control systems (ICS) to external servers could be risky and should be carefully monitored.

3. **Baseline Deviation:**
   - The fact that this connection was flagged as anomalous implies it deviated from the normal communication patterns established in the ICS environment.
   - This deviation might indicate a legitimate need for secure communication but could also suggest malicious activity, such as command-and-control (C2) communication or data exfiltration.

4. **Further Research:**
   - Verify if this external communication is part of an approved and documented process within the organization.
   - Conduct further investigation to determine the nature of the service being accessed by `TechCorp` from `NetSys`.
   - Review firewall rules and ensure that such external communications are necessary and properly secured.

### Conclusion:
This connection between the internal device (`TechCorp`) and the external server (`NetSys`) over HTTPS should be scrutinized further. Understanding the legitimate purpose of this communication is crucial to maintaining the security posture of the ICS environment.

This conversation also indicates an attempt from a local network device (`172.16.60.1` from TechCorp) to establish an HTTPS connection with an external IP address (`203.0.113.6`). The note "Likely blocked" suggests that the security measures in place may have prevented this connection from being fully established. However, even a single packet exchanged can be indicative of a probing attempt or a precursor to a more significant attack. Given the anomaly flag, it is essential to verify whether these devices are supposed to communicate externally and understand why the initial connection was blocked.

### Summary:
Both conversations involve local network devices (`172.16.50.1` and `172.16.60.1`, both from TechCorp) attempting to connect to an external IP address (`203.0.113.6`) on port 443 using ephemeral ports. The first conversation was not blocked, while the second one was likely intercepted by security measures. Both scenarios warrant further investigation to determine their legitimacy and potential security implications within the ICS environment.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough review of network policies and access controls to ensure that no unintended external connections are allowed.
- Investigate the purpose of these devices communicating with an external IP address over HTTPS.
- Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect and respond to such anomalies promptly.
