===============================


Conversation 1:
1. Device Identification:
   - The first device is identified as 172.16.50.1, which is a local private network IP address. Its MAC address is 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E and its manufacturer is TechCorp.
   - The second device is identified as 198.51.100.2, which is an external IP address. Its MAC address is 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34 and its manufacturer is NetSys.

2. Communication Details:
   - The devices are communicating over TCP port 443, with the local device using ephemeral (EPH) ports for outgoing traffic and the external device using port 443 for incoming traffic.
   - Port 443 is commonly used for secure communication protocols such as HTTPS and SSH.

3. Traffic Volume:
   - The total sum of packets exchanged between the devices is 5118.0.

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - This conversation indicates that a device on the local private network (TechCorp) is communicating with an external device (NetSys) over a secure connection.
   - While this activity may not necessarily be malicious, it is important to investigate further to ensure that the communication is authorized and necessary for the operation of the ICS environment.

Conversation 2:
1. Device Identification:
   - The first device is identified as having the IP address 172.16.60.1 and MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F, manufactured by TechCorp.
   - The second device is identified as having the IP address 198.51.100.2 and MAC address 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34, manufactured by NetSys.

2. Communication Details:
   - The communication involves an outgoing TCP connection from TechCorp's device (SRCIP: 172.16.60.1) to NetSys' device (DSTIP: 198.51.100.2) on port 443 (EPH).
   - The incoming communication is a response from NetSys' device (DSTIP: 198.51.100.2) back to TechCorp's device (SRCIP: 172.16.60.1) on port 443 (EPH).

3. Traffic Volume:
   - The total sum of packets exchanged between the devices is 1192.0 for outgoing and 1193.0 for incoming, resulting in a total of 2385.0 packets.

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - This conversation appears to be a typical communication pattern between two devices in an ICS environment, where one device initiates a connection to the other on port 443 (EPH) for data exchange.
   - However, since these connections are not part of the baseline/allowlist, further research is recommended to ensure that this communication is authorized and not indicative of any malicious activity or unauthorized access.

Conversation 3:
1. Device Identification:
   - SRCIP 172.16.50.1: This IP address belongs to a device within the local private network, possibly a workstation or server belonging to TechCorp. The MAC address is not provided in the data.
   - DSTIP 203.0.113.6: This IP address belongs to an external device, potentially located on the internet. The MAC address is not provided in the data.

2. Communication Details:
   - MFG Names: TechCorp (SRC) and NetSys (DST)
   - IP Addresses: 172.16.50.1 (SRC) and 203.0.113.6 (DST)
   - Ports: Ephemeral port (EPH) used by devices in an ICS environment for outgoing traffic (443), and the same ephemeral port for incoming traffic

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Total sum of packets exchanged between the devices: 3.0

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - The first connection attempt (SRCIP 172.16.50.1) was an attempted remote access to the external device (DSTIP 203.0.113.6). This could potentially indicate a security risk if the remote access was not authorized or properly secured.
   - The second connection attempt (SRCIP 172.16.60.1) was likely blocked, which is a positive sign as it indicates that the system has some form of protection in place to prevent unauthorized access. However, further investigation may be needed to determine why the access was attempted and if it was legitimate or not.

These connections are not part of the baseline/allowlist and were picked up as anomalies, which is why they need further research.

Conversation 4:
1. Device Identification:
   - SRCIP (Source IP): 172.16.1.1, belonging to the local private network.
   - DSTIP (Destination IP): 224.0.0.1, a multicast group management address.
   - SRCMAC (Source MAC): 18:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE, belonging to IndustrialTech devices.
   - DSTMAC (Destination MAC): 01:00:5E:AB:CD:EF, belonging to network devices.
   - SRCMFG (Source Manufacturer): IndustrialTech, a manufacturer of industrial control systems.
   - DSTMFG (Destination Manufacturer): Not specified, but it's likely a network device such as a router or switch.

2. Communication Details:
   - The communication is an IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) message, which is used to manage multicast group memberships in a local network.
   - The source port is not specified (NaN), and the destination port is also not applicable for IGMP messages.

3. Traffic Volume:
   - The total sum of packets exchanged between the devices is 3334.0.

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - This connection is part of the baseline/allowlist, as it's related to IGMP discovery, which is a common protocol used in industrial control systems for multicast communication.
   - However, the high volume of packets (3334.0) might indicate unusual activity or potential misconfiguration. Further research may be needed to confirm if this is normal behavior for this specific ICS environment.
