Conversation 1:
**Connection Analysis Report**

**Conversation ID:** Anomalous Connection 1

**Device Identification:**

* **Source Device (SRCIP):**
	+ IP Address: `172.16.50.1`
	+ MAC Address: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
	+ Manufacturer (MFG): TechCorp
* **Destination Device (DSTIP):**
	+ IP Address: `198.51.100.2`
	+ MAC Address: `10:AB:CD:EF:12:34`
	+ Manufacturer (MFG): NetSys

**Communication Details:**

* The source device (`172.16.50.1`) is using an ephemeral port (EPH) for outgoing traffic on TCP protocol, and the destination device (`198.51.100.2`) is responding with a TCP connection on port `443`.
* The source and destination devices are communicating over TCP protocol.

**Traffic Volume:**

* Total packets exchanged between devices: `2785.0` (src -> dst) + `2333.0` (dst -> src) = `5118.0`

**Implications and Concerns:**

This connection conversation appears to be a two-way communication between TechCorp's device (`172.16.50.1`) and NetSys's device (`198.51.100.2`). The use of ephemeral port EPH for outgoing traffic on the source device is unusual, as most ICS devices do not utilize ephemeral ports for communication.

The destination device is responding with a TCP connection on port `443`, which is typically used for HTTPS and other web-based protocols. This may indicate that the NetSys device is attempting to establish a secure communication channel with the TechCorp device.

However, since this conversation was detected as an anomaly, further research is required to determine if it is legitimate or malicious activity. Possible implications include:

* Unusual communication patterns between devices
* Potential security risks due to unexplained connections

Recommendation: Investigate the purpose and context of this connection conversation, and consider adding it to the baseline/allowlist if deemed legitimate. If suspected malicious activity, escalate for further analysis and potential incident response.
