Conversation 1:
1. Device Identification:
   - SRCIP: 172.16.50.1 (Manufacturer: Unknown, MAC Address: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E)
   - DSTIP: 198.51.100.2 (Manufacturer: NetSys, MAC Address: 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34)

2. Communication Details:
   - MFG: TechCorp (Source), NetSys (Destination)
   - IP Addresses: SRCIP: 172.16.50.1, DSTIP: 198.51.100.2
   - Ports:
     - Outgoing (SRCIP to DSTIP): EPH (Ephemeral Port) on PORT 443
     - Incoming (DSTIP to SRCIP): EPH (Ephemeral Port) on PORT 443

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Total packets exchanged: 2785.0 (SRCIP to DSTIP) and 2333.0 (DSTIP to SRCIP)

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - The communication between these two devices is occurring over PORT 443, which is typically used for secure HTTP communications. However, the ephemeral ports (EPH) are not typically used for secure communications and may indicate a potential security risk.
   - Further research is needed to determine the exact purpose of this communication and whether it is expected or an anomaly. It is recommended to investigate the manufacturers and models of these devices to better understand their communication protocols and potential vulnerabilities.

Conversation 2:
1. Device Identification:
   - SRCIP: 172.16.60.1, MFG: TechCorp, MAC: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F
   - DSTIP: 198.51.100.2, MFG: NetSys, MAC: 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34

2. Communication Details:
   - SRCIP: TechCorp, IP: 172.16.60.1, PORT: EPH (Ephemeral Port)
   - DSTIP: NetSys, IP: 198.51.100.2, PORT: 443 (TCP)

3. Traffic Volume:
   - Total packets exchanged: 1192.0 (SRCIP to DSTIP) and 1193.0 (DSTIP to SRCIP)

4. Implications and Concerns:
   - The communication is between two devices from different networks (TechCorp and NetSys).
   - The use of ephemeral port (EPH) by TechCorp might indicate a potential security risk, as it could be used for malicious activities.
   - The communication is not part of the baseline/allowlist, suggesting it needs further research.
   - The traffic volume is relatively high, which could indicate a significant amount of data being exchanged between these devices.

Conversation 3:
172.16.50.1 (SRCIP) is a device from an unknown manufacturer, with MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E. It is attempting to communicate with 203.0.113.6 (DSTIP), which is a device from TechCorp NetSys, with MAC address 10:AB:CD:EF:12:34. The communication is using ephemeral port EPH for outgoing traffic and port 443 for incoming traffic, which is typically used for HTTPS. The total number of packets exchanged between these devices is 2.0.

This connection is considered an anomaly as it is not part of the baseline/allowlist. Further research is needed to determine if this is a malicious attempt or a legitimate communication.

172.16.60.1 (SRCIP) is also a device from an unknown manufacturer, with MAC address 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5F. It is attempting to communicate with 203.0.113.6 (DSTIP), which is the same device as in the previous connection. The communication is using ephemeral port EPH for outgoing traffic and port 443 for incoming traffic. The total number of packets exchanged between these devices is 1.0.

This connection is also considered an anomaly and requires further research to determine its legitimacy.

Conversation 4:
172.16.1.1 (SRCIP) is a device from the local private network, likely an Industrial Tech device, as indicated by the manufacturer "IndustrialTech". The destination IP address 224.0.0.1 is not a common private or public IP address, suggesting potential external communication. The protocol used is IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol), which is typically used for multicast group management in ICS environments. The SRCPORT and DSTPORT are both set to NaN, indicating that no specific ports were used for outgoing and incoming traffic. The SRCMAC and DSTMAC are provided as "18:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE" and "01:00:5E:AB:CD:EF" respectively, which can be used to identify the devices. The CNT is set to 3334.0, suggesting that there were 3334 packets exchanged between the devices. This connection may require further research to determine if it is a normal or anomalous communication.
